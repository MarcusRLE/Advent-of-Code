# Advent of Code – How to Run Each Solution

This project contains one folder for each Advent of Code day (like `AoC25`, `AoC26`, etc.).  
Each folder includes everything needed to run that day's solution:

- `app.jar` — the compiled program  
- `run` — a small script that starts the program (works on Windows, macOS, and Linux)

You don’t need to build anything yourself.

## How to run a solution

1. Open your terminal (or Command Prompt / PowerShell on Windows)
2. Go into the folder of the day you want to run, for example:

```bash
cd AoC25
```

3. Run the program:

### On **Linux / macOS**

```bash
./run
```

### On **Windows**

```bat
run
```

That’s it — the solution for that day will start.

Each day is fully self-contained, so you can run any of them independently.
